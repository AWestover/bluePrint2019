# bluePrint2019
This is an application we made for a hackathon that allows people to write to a shared whiteboard screen.

# important code
* `ssh -R 80:localhost:5000 ssh.localhost.run`

# Features TO ADD
  1) color indicator rectangle in the top right corner
  2) infinite scrolling
  3) delete inactive boards
  4) host it somewhere? - just need to get arround the school ipad stuff, not really any other goals. Probably not heroku, because that might be a pain.
  5) Clear board
  6) export entire canvas to png
