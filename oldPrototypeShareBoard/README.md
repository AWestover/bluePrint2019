# shareBoard
This is an application I made for 2 people to draw on the same place. It is slightly questionable.

* now here is a new idea:
  I think it is much better to draw line segments than individual points
## complications:
    * start when mouse down, mouseDrag means extend the current curve that we are working on, then there is difficulty, need to transmit each shape separatlet, might not be so bad
    * I don't know how this will interact with the eraser, but it might be cool
